For example, a Hawkings Lab has 8 workers per shift; one mentor gives you 20 * (8-1)/8 = 17.5 workplace performance, but a Mentor working in a Diner (2 workers) will you give you 20*(2-1)/2=10 workplace performance, and a Mentor in a Grocer will give you nothing.\n \nThrifty colonists are perfect for working in Factories, because they reduce the amount of materials needed to manufacture. An Electronics Factory has 10 Engineers; if all of them are Thrifty, that's 50% Rare Metal consumption reduction, from 0.3 to 0.15! Note: the UI might show 0.2 but it's just rounding up, the actual number is 0.15; you should consider having a School/University Dome that exclusively trains Thrifty Engineers.\nThrifty colonists who work at Grocers, Diners, Electronics or Art Stores will also save in resources consumed, although just 5% (10% for the Diner); those working in Workshops will also save a lot of materials.\nThrifty colonists can also use their powers to reduce electricity consumption on buildings that don't normally consume resources, like Science Buildings. \n \nFixer colonists will fix any building they enter, which makes them great at keeping their residences, services and workplaces working properly. This is particularly interesting in Science Domes since those tend to require a lot of Electronics. \nTheir usefulness is diminished for other type of Domes, since most buildings maintenance is Concrete and Polymers, not Electronics; you should consider having a School/University Dome that exclusively trains Fixer Scientists.\nFixer colonists also make Smart Residences more appealing, since they can keep them maintained for free, negating the cost in Electronics. They're also loved by Blue Sun Corporation and Paradox Interactive, whose unique buildings consume Electronics.\n \n[h2] Strategy: Quirks [/h2]\n \nBrawlers exchange health for sanity; they will however never start a fight if their health is below 30 and they will never pick a colonist whose health is below 30. They will often visit the infirmary.\n \nEarly Birds and Night Owls will try to find a suitable shift for them, and will gain +5 comfort every day while working in their preferred shift, which allows them to maximize comfort even in the early game. But too many of them at the same workplace and they will start losing comfort from being unable to find a nice work shift. \n \nListeners are probably the most useful since they target the colonist with the lowest sanity in the dome and help them regain sanity. But..that colonist is usually them, since they constantly lose sanity from listening to others complain all the time. \n \n[h2] Mod Compatibility [/h2]\n(Not yet implemented) If you have my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2535835676] Seniors with Benefits [/url] mod, then Seniors will be able to remove the new Flaws.",
