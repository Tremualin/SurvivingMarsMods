It's easier to ignore Renegades, or, if you are playing with Rebel Yell, to move them into a murder dome. Some mods have added a few ways to deal with Renegades, but I felt like they were missing something, so I made my own.\n\nI wanted to:\n1. Replace Renegade murder domes with Rehabilitation domes\n2. Make Officers and Security Stations more appealing\n3. Make Crime more diverse and punishing\n4. Make Rebel-Yell more fun\n5. Add more Renegades to regular games\nAnd I think I've accomplished all points with this mod.\n\n[h1] Table of Features [h1]\nThis table provides a summary of all features; further down there are detailed descriptions and clarifications for each feature and followed by a strategy discussion. You might find strategies that I didn't even think of.\n\n<table>\n<thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Affects</th><th>Effect</th><th>Unlocked with</th></tr></thead><tbody>\n <tr><td>Toggle: Rehabilitation center</td><td>Residences</td><td>Houses Renegades who need Rehabilitation</td><td>Behavorial Shaping</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Rehabilitation</td><td>Security Stations</td><td>Cures Renegades in Rehabilitation Centers</td><td>Behavorial Shaping</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Vigilance</td><td>Renegades</td><td>Renegades in Rehabilitation Centers don't commit crimes</td><td>Behavorial Shaping</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Perk: Vindicated</td><td>Colonists</td><td>+20 performance and cannot become a Renegade ever again</td><td>Behavioral Melding</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Upgrade: Vindication</td><td>Security Stations</td><td>Cured Renegades become Vindicated </td><td>Behavioral Melding</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Upgrade: Criminal Psychologists</td><td>Security Stations</td><td>+10 performance if at least one medical building present in dome. +20 if Spire or Hospital</td><td>Supportive Community</td></tr>\n <tr><td>First Responders</td><td>Domes</td><td>+(2*performance) comfort for each officer working in security.</td><td>Emergency Training</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Fitness for Duty Evaluations</td><td>Security Stations</td><td>Renegades can't work on security and will be fired at the end of the shift  if turning Renegade</td><td>Mod installation</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Off-duty Hero</td><td>Officers</td><td>5% or 10% (Supportive Community) chance to stop suicides and become a Celebrity</td><td>Mod installation</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Domestic Violence</td><td>Colonists</td><td>30% chance to inflict health and/or sanity damage on other colonists when unhappy</td><td>Mod installation</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Domestic Violence: Reports</td><td>Colonists</td><td>33% chance that colonists who commit domestic violence can become Renegades</td><td>Mod installation</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Domestic Violence: Survivors</td><td>Colonists</td><td>Survivors of domestic violence have a chance to developt flaws </td><td>Mod installation</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Violence Prevention</td><td>Security Stations</td><td>Security Stations reduce the negative effects of domestic violence</td><td>Mod installation</td></tr>\n <tr><td>Curable Flaw: Violent</td><td>Colonists</td><td>Commits domestic violence more often.

Based on Nordic prisons, Rehabilitation centers are by all means regular residences, except they can only house Renegades. Renegades in the rehabilitation center will generate points each shift towards rehabilitation, after which they will lose their status of Renegade (much like Sanatoriums, but it takes more work). Unlike Sanatoriums, Martian-born Adaptability does not make the process faster. Hovering over the button shows progress towards Rehabilitation for each Renegade.\n\nEach Rehabilitation Center must be monitored by at least one Security building in the Dome. Each worker in a Security building can monitor up to 4 renegades at a time. Rehabilitation speed depends on the happiness of the Renegade, the Comfort of the residence and the performance of the monitoring worker. If you don't have enough workers, some Renegades won't gain any points and will never rehabilitate.\n\nRenegades in Rehabilitation Centers won't commit crimes (unless security buildings are understaffed). The usual Renegade warning has been updated to negate renegades in Rehabilitation Centers.\n\nPoints required to cure a Renegade = 700\nPoint generation formula (per 8 work shift): 70 * (RenegadeSanity/100) * (RenegadeComfort/100) * (ResidenceComfort/100) * SecurityStationPerformance\nExample1: A renegade with 70 Sanity, 70 Comfort, in an Apartment (35 Comfort), and a Security Station with 100% performance, will generate 70 * 70/100 * 70/100 * 35/100 * 100/100 = 12 points per shift, and will rehabilitate in 19.5 sols\nExample2: A renegade with 70 Sanity, 70 Comfort, in a Living Complex with Home Collective (60 Comfort), and a Security Station with 100% performance, will generate 70 * 70/100 * 70/100 * 60/100 * 100/100 = 20.6 points per shift and will rehabilitate in 11 sols\nExample3: A renegade with 80 Sanity, 80 Comfort, in a Living Complex with Home Collective and a Hanging Gardens (90 Comfort), and a Security Station with 120% performance, will generate 70 * 80/100 * 80/100 * 90/100 * 120/100 = 48.4 points per shift and will rehabilitate in 4.8 sols\n\nUnlike Sanatoriums, Renegades can continue working/studying while in Rehabilitation, at their usual reduced performance.\nResidences with Comfort over 100 will increase rehabilitation speed.\n\n[h3]Upgrade: Vindication[/h3]\nUnlocked with \"Behavioral Melding\" (which makes Sanatoriums replace flaws with perks) \nRehabilitated Renegades gain the \"Vindicated\" perk, which prevents them from becoming Renegades again, and gives them a permanent +20 performance as they try to compensate for their past crimes. Cannot be obtained any other way. \n\n[h3]Upgrade: Criminal Psychologists[/h3]\nUnlocked with \"Supportive Community\"\nDirect access to psychologists allows Officers to put themselves in the mind of Renegades. Increases the performance of the Security building by 10 if there's a medical building in the Dome. Doubled if the medical building is a Spire or a Hospital.\n\n[h3]First Responders[/h3]\nAutomatically unlocked after researching \"Emergency Training\"\nOfficers working in security buildings provide emergency services which increases the comfort of all residences by 2 (affected by performance) for each officer working in a security station during that shift; this effect stacks so you could easily have 15 Officers working together for a 30 comfort increase. But who would build 5 security stations in the same Dome?  \n\n[h3] Fitness for Duty Evaluations [h3]\nOfficers are evaluated for Duty before they're assigned to Security Stations and continuously after that; Renegades can no longer be assigned to security buildings; and will be fired when their shift ends if they become Renegades while working there.\n\n[h3]Off-duty Heros[/h3]\nEach officer living in the same dome as a person who attempts suicide has a 5% chance of being close enough to the site of the attempted suicide to respond to the call and attempt to talk the person out of it.\n\nEach officer who responds to the call has a 5% (10% with SupportiveCommunity) chance of being capable of talking the person out of taking their own life, with a 5% (1% with SupportiveCommunity) chance of critical failure (the person immediately takes their own life and the Officer will lose 20 morale for 3 days). Officers who save a person this way will gain (+10) additional morale for 3 days and will become Celebrities.\n\nIf none of the officers manage to talk the person out of it, the person will commit Suicide.\n\n[h2] Crime [h2]\nThere are several new types of crimes for Renegades to commit which also scale with the number of Renegades. In the other hand; domestic violence adds a new type crime through which colonists can become Renegades; a crime that can be committed by any Colonist (even Children). Domestic violence is also a new way for colonists to lose health and gain flaws, making medical buildings and sanatoriums even more important than before.\n\n[h3]Domestic Violence[/h3]\nUnhappy (low morale, sanity, comfort or health) colonists (including Children) and unsupervised Renegades have a 30% chance to cause up to -15 health and/or sanity damage to other people in their same residence (chosen randomly). The more flaws a colonist has, the higher the chances (+1% each); the more perks it has, the lower the chances (-1% each). Researching Supportive Community lowers the base chance of Domestic Violence by 70%. Security Stations in the Dome reduce the health and sanity loss by up to 80%.\n\nChildren who are victims (or perpetrators) of domestic will develop at least one flaw when older (same as SanityBreakdown flaws). Other victims of domestic violence might develop flaws instantly (same chance and same flaws as SanityBreakdown flaws). Perpetrators of domestic violence (except Children) have a 33% chance of being reported to authorities and becoming Renegades, if they aren't already. \n\nRenegades living in Rehabilitation will not commit domestic violence, unless left unsupervised (not enough Officers). Renegades in rehabilitation who are perpetrators of domestic violence will suffer a rehabilitation setback (-100 points); as will the victim. \n \nHomeless people will find a victim among other homeless people.\n\n[h3] Flaw: Violent [/h3]\nViolent people will resort to domestic violence (100% chance) whenever they're unhappy, and sometimes (30% chance, reduced by Supportive Community) even when not unhappy. Their victims will be more scared to talk about it (11% chance of becoming Renegades, instead of 33%). Violent people cannot become Vindicated until they work on their anger issues at the Sanatorium. Can be obtained via sanity breakdown or by being the victim of domestic violence. \n\nIf selected as a domestic assault target, Violent people will immediately retaliate (Sanity and Health loss for the aggressor). \nIf Senior with Benefits is installed, Violent can be removed by Vindicated Seniors.\n\n[b] Crime Scaling [/b]\nNew crimes have been added to the list of possible crimes, and more importantly, they now scale in effect with the number of Renegades in the Dome which aren't negated by Security Stations or Rehabilitation Centers. Crimes are chosen at random, provided that the minimum number of Renegades allows it. When Rebel-Yell is activated; the minimum number renegades required for a crime to be triggered is reduced by 2. \n\n[b]Protests[/b]\nRequires 4 Renegades.\nWhen low in numbers, Renegades will organize protests in hopes of luring others to join their cause; these protests lower the morale of non-Renegades in the dome by 1 per Renegade participating in the protest, an effect which lasts for 3 sols (but doesn't stack with additional protests). Protests are usually accompanied by ludicrous messaging like \"Stop sending us to murder domes!\".\n\n[b]Vandalism[/b]\nRequires 4 Renegades.\nWhen low in numbers, Renegades will often vandalize public property. Each Renegade participating in the act will increase the maintenance bar of a random building in the dome by 5%. \n\n[b]Resource Stealing[/b]\nRequires 8 Renegades.\nEach Renegade participating will steal at least 1 resource of the chosen type. \n\n[b]Embezzlement[/b]\nRequires 8 Renegades.\nMars might be cashless, but Earth isn't. Renegades who want to escape to Earth might steal 1% of your current funding per Renegade.\n\n[b]Sabotage[/b]\nRequires 12 Renegades.\nDestroys 1 building in the dome per every 8 Renegades.\n\n[h1] Strategy [h1]\n\n[h2] Early to Mid Game [h2]\nBe extra careful not to demand too much from your colonists; low sanity can quickly lead to an increase in Domestic Violence, which leads to even lower sanity, which leads to more flaws, more Domestic Violence and more Renegades, and can quickly destroy a Colony.\n\nDon't forget that Supportive Community lowers the chances of Domestic Violence, the chances of gaining flaws when this happens, and unlocks a powerful Security Station upgrade. A Security Station in the early game can help with the sanity losses from disasters, and keep Renegades in check. \n\nIf you manage to research Emergency Training; remember it unlocks a bonus to Officers working in Security Stations which increases the comfort of residences and can boost the birth rate of your colony; a bonus which scales with performance.\n\nIf you have Space Race, keep an eye on the other colonies. Once they become friendly, you can send your Officers to poach from them; an early Martian University can make a huge difference if all rivals are friendly, with a 5% chance of failure.\n\n[h2] Mid to Late Game [h2]\n\nIn the mid to late game, be sure to send all your Violent Colonists to a Sanatorium, and be sure to have a Rehabilitation Center and a Security Station in the same dome, in case any of those colonists becomes a Renegade. If playing with Rebel-Yell, you should absolutely build a Rehabilitation Dome, and send all your Renegades over there; or you could build smaller Rehabilitation Centers in all of your domes using the Security Post from the InDome Buildings DLC and the 3 Hex LivingComplex/SmartHouse from the Colony Design DLC.\n\n[h1] Compatibility [h1]\n\nThis mod should be compatible with other mods that allow Renegades to be cured; however, using any method other than the Rehabilitation Center will no provide the Vindicated perk.\n\nIf you are using the Security Post in the In-Dome-Buildings DLC; now that it is compatible with this mod, however, the DLC is broken and you need another of my mods (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2563628545) to fix it. Otherwise the Security Post does nothing at all.",
