    'description', "This mod makes the first 50% half of Terraforming easier to start in the early to mid game, while making the other 50% of Terraforming harder but more engaging. Most of the changes are save-game compatible; but some buildings will require rebuilding for some of the new effects to apply. Most likely incompatible with other Terraforming balance mods, including my previous mods (which you should disable)\n\n[h1]Tech tree changes[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Early Terraforming:[/b] position 1 is now always Greenhouse Mars. Positions 2 to 4 are filled (in random order) by: Martian Vegetation, InterplanetaryProjects, GrowthStimulators and TerraformingSubsidies.\n[*][b]GHG Factory:[/b] increases Temperature [b]and Atmosphere[/b]. More effective while Atmosphere is below 25%. \n[*][b]Terraforming Subsidies:[/b] no longer immediately grants $1B. Instead, you get $300M from your sponsor once upon research, and once again every time you reach a Terraforming Threshold (and for any you've already reached), for a total of about $8.0B after you've done them all (100% Terraforming).\n[*][b]Growth Stimulators:[/b] also increases Forestation Plants contribution to Vegetation by 50%.\n[*][b]Import Greenhouse Gases:[/b] effects improved from 2% Atmosphere and 1% Temperature to 4% Atmosphere and 3% Temperature. 2 can appear at the same time (was 1).\n[*][b]Core Heat Convector:[/b] heated area has been tripled. Use it to remove cold areas before Temperature reaches 100%, and to overcome heat loss (see Temperature loss).\n[*][b]Carbonate Processor:[/b] halved Atmosphere production; to make other Atmosphere choices more interesting.\n[*][b]Launch Magnetic Shield:[/b] Reduces Atmosphere loss by 0.3% per sol (same as am amplified Magnetic Field Generator), and is available even if Atmosphere is at 100% (max 10). 2 Projects can appear at the same time (was 1), and they appear faster than before.\n[*][b]Launch Space Mirror:[/b] Increases Temperature gain by 0.3% per sol (instead of 10% once), and is available even if Temperature is at 100% (max 10). 2 Projects can appear at the same time (was 1), and they appear faster than before.\n[*][b]Water Conservation System:[/b] unlocks Rainwater Collectors (Upgrade); which will refill water tanks with 1% of their max water capacity per hour when it rains (so, 1-1.5 water per hour for Water Tanks, 10-15 water per hour for Large Water Tanks).\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Changes to Vegetation[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Biological Discoveries:[/b] 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% Vegetation will spawn 1 additional Breakthrough somewhere in the main map.\n[*][b]Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger:[/b] Forestation Plants contribute more Vegetation according to what they're planting (1x from Lichen, 1.5x from Grass, 2x from Bushes, 3x from Trees, up to 5x from Mixed Trees, whichever is highest, but only if soil quality allows it). Min: 0.01%, Max:0.075% (with Mixed Trees and Growth Stimulators). No longer stops contributing after 40%.\n[*][b]Applied Botany:[/b] Forestation Plants have a 0.01% chance per hour of generating Tech Anomalies (the ones that unlock new tech) in their area. This effects disappears once you reach 100% Terraforming (to reduce the number of notifications from anomalies).\n[*][b]Reproduction Bonus:[/b] Passively increases Vegetation (min: 0%, max: 1%); this effect is higher the more Vegetation there is. Max is doubled after planting your first tree.\n[*][b]Transpiration Bonus:[/b] Passively increases Water (min: 0%, max: 1%); this effect is higher the more Vegetation there is. Max is doubled after planting your first tree.\n[*][b]Photosynthesis Bonus:[/b] Passively increases Atmosphere (min: 0%, max: 1%); this effect is higher the more Vegetation there is. Max is doubled after planting your first tree.\n[*][b]Cooling Penalty:[/b] Vegetation decreases global temperature (min: 0%, max 1%); this effect is higher the more Vegetation there is. Max is doubled after planting your first tree.\n[*][b]Biological Crust:[/b] Lowers the duration of dust storms (instead of Atmosphere). Eliminates Dust Storms at 30%.\n[*][b]Oxygen is Needed:[/b] 50% Vegetation is required for Open Domes.\n[*][b]I see Fire:[/b] When Atmosphere and Temperature are above 50%; but Water is below 80%, Wildfires will appear on the Planetary View, decreasing Vegetation by 0.3% per sol per Wildfire (max 5). They can be put out with 200 Concrete. All Wildfires will stop automatically when it rains (so save those Cloud Seeding missions). \n[/list]\n\n[h1]Changes to Water[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Enhanced Lakes:[/b] Lakes produce twice the amount of Water per sol.\n[*][b]Greenhouse Water Vapors:[/b] Lakes will also increase Atmosphere and Temperature by a 1/3 of their Water per sol value.\n[*][b]Artificial Beauty:[/b] Lakes improve Dome Comfort of all nearby domes (up to twice the dome area) once full and not frozen. The bigger the lake, the higher the comfort (2, 5, 10 and 20). Stacks with multiple Lakes.\n[*][b]Moisture Absorption:[/b] Moisture Vaporators absorb 0.02% of Water, reducing overall Water the more Vaporators you have.\n[*][b]Water Escape:[/b] While Atmosphere is weak, up to 2% of Water is lost each sol.\n[*][b]Low Clouds Effect:[/b] Water increases the number of sun-reflecting clouds in the Atmosphere, reducing Temperature by up to 2%.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Changes To Temperature[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Keeping it Warm:[/b] Temperature lowers electricity costs of all outdoor buildings by up to 50% at 100% Temperature. Note; this applies to their base cost, so a building that costs 5 (+10 with Amplify) will cost 2.5 (+10 with Amplify).\n[*][b]Heat Conservation:[/b] Lakes heat up faster, producing up to 50% more Water, when Temperature is at 100%.\n[*][b]Greenhouse Effect:[/b] While Atmosphere is lower than 80%, up to 3% of current Temperature is lost. When Atmosphere is higher than 80%, up to 1% of Temperature is retained.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Changes to Atmosphere[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Dust Storm Who?:[/b] No longer stops dust storms; Vegetation stops Dust Storms instead.\n[*][b]Weak Magnetic Field:[/b] Max Atmosphere loss per Sol doubled (4% vs 2%)\n[*][b]Hello Blue Skies:[/b] When Atmosphere reaches 50% and the skies becomes blue, colonists will gain +10 morale.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Miscellaneous[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Walking on Sunshine:[/b] When Mars becomes habitable, all workplaces gain +15 work radius (meaning colonists can work in buildings further away from the domes; and domes can include more vistas/research sites). Note: if Mars is no longer habitable, this bonus will disappear as well; but vistas/research bonuses will remain. Note: affects underground domes too; I haven't found a way not to.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Known Issues[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]If the description for the Terraforming Parameters doesn't fit the screen; please install Infobar More Info https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1775006723 and increase the Rollover Size in the Mod Configuration to 60+.\n[*]If a Terraforming notification starts repeating; your parameters are oscillating  too close to the trigger for that notification. Build more Terraforming buildings so they remain above the trigger for the notification. \n[/list]\n\n\nSources: \nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110914161729.htm\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/evaporation/\nhttps://climate.nasa.gov/news/423/carbon-dioxide-controls-earths-temperature/\nhttps://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-climate/\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2588828764]Steam[/url]\n[url=https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/authors/Tremualin]Paradox[/url]\n[url=https://github.com/Tremualin/SurvivingMarsMods]Github[/url]",
